Variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values: vehicle length, vehicle weight, and ground clearance. All three of these variables had p-values that are well below the .05 alpha level of significance. AWD and spoiler angle on the other hand are above the 0.05 threshold with p-values of 0.307 and 0.185, respectively. Therefore, they do not provide a signifcant amount of non-random variance to the mpg values.
